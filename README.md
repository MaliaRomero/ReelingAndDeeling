Playable Build:
https://maliaromero.github.io/ReelingAndDeeling/

How to play:

Draw a card from any deck by pushing one of the deck buttons. The deeper the depth, the more bait it costs but there is a higher chance to get better cards. The shallow costs 1 bait, deep costs 2, and unfathomable costs 3 bait, and you can only draw if you have enough bait. 

Discard one card by clicking on it, this is how you will be able to get more bait. You may only discard one card per turn, or you can decide to skip. Once a card is discarded, an event will play. This can be good or bad, so be careful! If you are able to, you can draw again and repeat!

The trophy points from events are permanent but the trophy points from fish cards will go away when you discard. Be careful!

**Note: Current bugs: If you donâ€™t have enough bait and click a button worth more than what you have, it moves to the discard phase and bugs out the game. Working on a fix.

The game will randomly crash. This is not your fault! I think it has to do with the way cards are called, and trying to figure this out.
